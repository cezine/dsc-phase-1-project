# Phase 1 Project
## Microsoft Movie Studio Genre R.O.I. Analysis

**Author**: Samantha Baltodano, Jesus Baquiax, Shane Mangold, Senjin Yang


## Overview 

This project analyzes which movie genres Microsoft's Movie Studios should invest their resources in producing using exploratory data analysis. Microsoft can use this analysis to determine which genres have the largest worldwide Return On Investment (R.O.I), how the R.O.I performs in domestic vs international markets, and which directors and producers have worked in the movies with the highest R.O.I.


## Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.


### The Data

The movie datasets we used:

* [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
* [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)
* [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
* [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)
* API call to IMDB(?)


### Methods

This project uses descriptive analysis and visualizations including trends over time. This provides Microsoft a useful overview of a genre's R.O.I. The three questions explored are:

1) What is the average ROI by genre? Out of our top 3-5 genres, let's take a look at best case and worst case ROI and decipher what may have influenced the success (or lack of success) a film had.

2) Does the average ROI by genre follow a similar trend when compared between domestic and foreign markets?

3) Is there any particular director/producer who appears frequently in the top 50 movies over the past 10 years?
